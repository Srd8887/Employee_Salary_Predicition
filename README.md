> *“Can we predict how much an employee should earn based on their experience, role, and skills?”*  
This project dives into that question using **Linear Regression** 📈.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Employee salaries are influenced by multiple factors — job title, years of experience, education, etc.  
In this project, I built a **Linear Regression model** to predict employee salaries and evaluate how well machine learning can estimate compensation trends.

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍  
   - Visualized salary distributions  
   - Explored correlations between variables  
   - Identified key factors affecting salary  

3. **Model Development** 🤖  
   - Implemented **Linear Regression** using scikit-learn  
   - Split dataset into training & testing sets  

4. **Model Evaluation** 📊  
   - Metrics: **MAE, RMSE, R² Score**  
   - Compared predicted vs. actual salaries

## 📊 Results  

- ✅ The model predicts salaries with reasonable accuracy  
- 📉 **Error metrics** demonstrate areas for improvement  
- 📈 Clear trend observed between **experience** and **salary**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  

- Use **Multiple Regression** with interaction terms  
- Try **Regularization (Ridge/Lasso)** to improve accuracy  
- Deploy the model using **Flask / Streamlit**
